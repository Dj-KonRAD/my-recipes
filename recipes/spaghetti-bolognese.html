    <p><h4>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather. 
        <br>The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, 
        <br>you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute 1/2 cup of 
        <br>red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</h4></p>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                <br>Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                <br>until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning 
                <br>occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano to bacon; 
                <br>continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until 
                <br>fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and 
                <br>completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, 
                <br>about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, season 
                <br>with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil .</li>
            <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
