    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven 
                <br>or heavy pot over medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat is cooked through,
                <br> 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, 
                <br>Italian-style crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, 
                <br>salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into 
                <br>meat mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce for at least 1 hour 
                <br>(up to 6 for best flavor). Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; 
                <br>let soak for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 
                <br>nutmeg into egg until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
